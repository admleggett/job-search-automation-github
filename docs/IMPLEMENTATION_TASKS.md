# Implementation Tasks: Daily Job Discovery Flow

## Overview

This document breaks down the UX workflow into concrete implementation tasks, focusing on automating the daily job discovery and notification process.

## Target UX Flow (Steps 1-2)

```
9:00 AM - Library searches job boards, finds 3 new matches
9:05 AM - User gets GitHub email: "ðŸŽ¯ 3 New Job Opportunities"
```

## Task Breakdown

- Support different job count scenarios

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] JSON parsing handles all library output formats
- [ ] Issue title reflects job count accurately
- [ ] Job listings formatted consistently
- [ ] Labels applied correctly (job-digest, automated)
- [ ] Edge cases handled gracefully

#### Task 2.3: GitHub Actions Custom Action

**Objective**: Reusable action for creating digest issues
**Files to Create**:

- `.github/actions/create-digest-issue/action.yml`
- `.github/actions/create-digest-issue/src/index.ts`
- `.github/actions/create-digest-issue/package.json`

**Requirements**:

- Accept library JSON as input
- Create GitHub issue using REST API
- Set outputs (issue number, URL)
- Handle GitHub API errors
- Provide detailed logging

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Action accepts required inputs correctly
- [ ] GitHub issue created successfully
- [ ] Outputs set for downstream use
- [ ] Error handling prevents action failures
- [ ] Logging provides debugging information

#### Task 2.4: Email Notification Integration

**Objective**: Ensure user receives GitHub email notification
**Files to Create**:

- `docs/GITHUB_NOTIFICATIONS.md`
- `scripts/test-notifications.py`

**Requirements**:

- Configure GitHub notification settings
- Test email delivery timing
- Verify email content and formatting
- Handle notification preferences
- Document setup requirements

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] GitHub notifications properly configured
- [ ] Email delivered within 5 minutes of issue creation
- [ ] Email subject line matches expected format
- [ ] Email content readable and actionable
- [ ] Setup documentation complete

### Phase 3: Integration Testing

#### Task 3.1: End-to-End Workflow Test

**Objective**: Validate complete Steps 1-2 flow
**Files to Create**:

- `tests/integration/daily-discovery.test.ts`
- `scripts/simulate-daily-flow.py`

**Requirements**:

- Mock job discovery with sample data
- Test complete workflow execution
- Verify issue creation and formatting
- Validate notification delivery
- Measure execution timing

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

### Library Dependencies

- job-search-automation library must be available and working
- Library must output valid JSON format
- API keys and credentials properly configured

### GitHub Environment

- Repository secrets configured (API keys, tokens)
- GitHub Actions enabled
- Notification settings configured
- Time zone settings accurate

### Development Environment

- TypeScript/Node.js setup for custom actions
- Python environment for integration scripts
- Testing framework configured
- Local development tools ready

## Success Metrics

### Functional Metrics

- Job discovery completes within 3 minutes
- Issue creation completes within 1 minute
- Email notification delivered within 5 minutes
- Zero false positives in job matching
- 100% uptime for scheduled workflows

### User Experience Metrics

- Issue format readable on mobile and desktop
- Email subject line clearly indicates job count
- Job listings scannable within 30 seconds
- Interactive elements work on first click
- Professional appearance maintains credibility

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Library API changes**: Pin library version, test before updates
- **GitHub API rate limits**: Implement exponential backoff
- **Workflow failures**: Add retry logic and error notifications
- **Time zone issues**: Use user's configured timezone
- **Secret exposure**: Use GitHub Secrets, rotate regularly

### User Experience Risks

- **Email spam**: Ensure consistent timing, professional format
- **Information overload**: Limit job count, prioritize by relevance
- **Mobile formatting**: Test on multiple devices and screen sizes
- **Notification fatigue**: Provide opt-out mechanisms
- **Professional appearance**: Review formatting, maintain consistency

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Week 1)**: Complete Task 1.1 (GitHub Actions setup)
2. **Short term (Week 2)**: Complete Tasks 1.2-1.3 (Configuration and library integration)
3. **Medium term (Week 3)**: Complete Tasks 2.1-2.3 (Issue creation system)
4. **Validation (Week 4)**: Complete Tasks 2.4, 3.1-3.2 (Testing and validation)

This implementation plan provides the foundation for the automated job discovery and notification system described in the UX workflow.
